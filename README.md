- 👋 Hi, I’m @hafidzfurqon a passionate fullstack developer with hands-on experience in developing end-to-end web applications — from planning and UI development to backend   architecture, deployment, and maintenance.
- 👀 I’m interested in Design and coding
- ⚡ Fun fact: i like journaling
- there's no bug too big, no feature too complex, and no frontend/backend that can't be conquered 😎
You’re not just building apps — you’re building momentum.
